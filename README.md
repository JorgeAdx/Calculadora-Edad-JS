# Age Calculator (JavaScript)
[EN] This module can be easily integrated as part of a larger project or used as a practice exercise.

## How it works:

The user is required to enter a valid date in the DD/MM/YYYY format.
The program verifies whether the entered birth date exists and follows the correct format. If the date is valid, it performs the age calculation.
Additionally, the program displays a message indicating whether the birth year is a leap year or the current date corresponds to the user's birthday.
